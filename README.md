# FlaskTelemServer
FlaskTelemServer is a minimal micro service using Flask and Pydantic to accept requests from SausageFileConverter in order to track user usage data.

## Usage data can be used to see:
*Which users haven't yet used the product - Does the product not succesfully solve their problem or is the problem it solves not urgent enough?
*Which users have launched the product but have not yet used it - Is the interface easy enough to navigate?  Are there critical bugs stopping the user from using the product?
*Users who have only used it only a couple of times - Does it not deliver the value which the user expected?  Is the problem only a temporary one?
*Users that are regular and happy - Do these users know other people that could benefit from the product?  Are there features that would make their life even easier?
*Users that use it an insane amount - Are they using your product in a way that you didn't expect?  Are you solving an even bigger problem for them that you hadn't noticed?
